# GSW

## About the project  

I have been a big fan of Golden State Warriors.  
One of my goals was to make a page that introduce  
this amazing team to other people.  
That is why I decided to make this page.  
There are 3 big sections in this page  
which are 'Home', 'Team', and 'News'.  

This project required a lot of data about GSW,  
so I had to use power of API.  
I subscribed 2 APIs from RapidApi.  
One is 'API-NBA' for fetching GSW players' info and stats,  
and the other is 'Free News' for fetching news about GSW.  

### Home  
Home section is made for introducing overview of GSW.  
User can first watch a title which has a short video as a background.  
Then, there are team stats of GSW during 21-22 regular season.
Finally, there is a image celebrating to be a 21-22 NBA champion.  

### Team  
At first, users can see leaderboard button and roster of GSW.  
When users click a player of the roster,  
it leads to a detail page of the player.  
The detail page illustrates player's info and stats.  
When users click a leaderboard button,  
it shows a leader of each section in GSW.  

### News
This section includes news about GSW.  
Each news shows its title and description.  
When users click a news, it leads to the news page directly.
